# 🔍 Investigation Summary: TTS Decryption Failure

## 🎯 Root Cause
The **"Decryption failed: The operation failed for an operation-specific reason"** error was caused by **PostgreSQL's `bytea` column converting encrypted data to hex format**, which corrupted the binary data needed for AES-GCM decryption.

## 🧪 Test Scripts Created

### 1. **`src/test-tts-isolated.js`**
- **Purpose**: Test TTS generation without encryption
- **What it does**: Bypasses encryption, tests Google TTS API directly
- **Result**: ✅ TTS generation works perfectly
- **Key finding**: The issue was NOT with TTS API or MP3 generation

### 2. **`src/test-encryption.js`**
- **Purpose**: Test encryption/decryption in isolation
- **What it does**: Encrypts and decrypts a test API key
- **Result**: ✅ Encryption/decryption logic works perfectly
- **Key finding**: The issue was NOT with the encryption algorithm

### 3. **`src/test-with-astro-env.js`**
- **Purpose**: Test decryption with real database data
- **What it does**: Loads environment variables, fetches encrypted data from database, attempts decryption
- **Result**: ❌ Decryption failed with database data
- **Key finding**: The issue was with the stored encrypted data format

### 4. **`src/debug-data-format.js`**
- **Purpose**: Analyze the exact format of stored encrypted data
- **What it does**: Examines raw database data, tests different conversion methods
- **Result**: Found data was stored as JSON-encoded Buffer format
- **Key finding**: Data format mismatch between storage and decryption

### 5. **`src/debug-hex-data.js`**
- **Purpose**: Analyze hex-encoded encrypted data
- **What it does**: Tests hex conversion, examines data structure
- **Result**: Found data was hex-encoded with wrong structure
- **Key finding**: Encrypted data was corrupted during storage

### 6. **`src/test-fresh-encryption.js`**
- **Purpose**: Test encryption/decryption with fresh data
- **What it does**: Encrypts API key, converts to hex format, tests decryption
- **Result**: ✅ Fresh encryption/decryption works perfectly
- **Key finding**: Confirmed the process works with correct data format

### 7. **`src/test-api-key-length.js`**
- **Purpose**: Test API endpoint with full Google API key
- **What it does**: Sends full API key to API, tests storage and retrieval
- **Result**: ❌ API accepted key but decryption still failed
- **Key finding**: Issue was with database column type, not API processing

### 8. **`src/test-column-length.js`**
- **Purpose**: Test if database column truncates data
- **What it does**: Tests different storage formats, checks data integrity
- **Result**: Found `bytea` column converts data to hex format
- **Key finding**: **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED** - PostgreSQL `bytea` column corruption

## 🛠️ Solution Implemented

### Database Schema Fix
```sql
-- Changed encrypted_key from bytea to text
ALTER TABLE tts_credentials ALTER COLUMN encrypted_key TYPE text;
```

### API Endpoint Fix
```typescript
// Store as base64 string instead of Buffer
const encryptedKeyBase64 = encryptedKey.toString('base64');
```

### Decryption Logic Fix
```typescript
// Handle base64 strings properly
if (typeof encryptedData === 'string') {
  buffer = Buffer.from(encryptedData, 'base64');
}
```

## 📊 Test Results Summary

| Test Script | Purpose | Result | Key Finding |
|-------------|---------|--------|-------------|
| `test-tts-isolated.js` | TTS Generation | ✅ Success | TTS API works fine |
| `test-encryption.js` | Encryption Logic | ✅ Success | Algorithm works fine |
| `test-with-astro-env.js` | Database Data | ❌ Failed | Data format issue |
| `debug-data-format.js` | Data Analysis | 🔍 Found | JSON Buffer format |
| `debug-hex-data.js` | Hex Analysis | 🔍 Found | Hex encoding issue |
| `test-fresh-encryption.js` | Fresh Data | ✅ Success | Process works |
| `test-api-key-length.js` | API Testing | ❌ Failed | Storage issue |
| `test-column-length.js` | Column Testing | 🔍 Found | **ROOT CAUSE** |

## 🎉 Final Outcome

**Problem**: PostgreSQL `bytea` column converted encrypted data to hex format, breaking AES-GCM decryption.

**Solution**: Changed database schema to use `text` column with base64 storage.

**Result**: ✅ TTS credentials now encrypt/decrypt correctly, job worker works properly.

## 🧹 Cleanup

All test scripts can be removed as they were diagnostic tools:
- `src/test-*.js` files
- `src/debug-*.js` files  
- `src/fix-*.js` files
- `src/clear-*.js` files

The investigation successfully identified and resolved the TTS decryption failure! 🚀
